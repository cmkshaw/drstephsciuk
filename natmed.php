				<li> <strong>To emphasize prevention</strong>, by partnering with the patient to assess risk factors and recommend appropriate naturopathic interventions to maintain health and prevent illness.</li>
				<li id="natmed_principles"><strong> To support the healing power of the body</strong>, by recognizing and removing obstacles to the body's inherent self-healing process.</li>
