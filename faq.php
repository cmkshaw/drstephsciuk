					<p><strong>Can I still see my Medical doctor?</strong></p>
					<p>Yes, of course! Naturopathic medicine is important in integrative healthcare and treatments can be used alone or in conjunction with conventional medicine. Dr. Sciuk encourages integrative care and will encourage an open diaglogue with your entire healthcare team.</p>

					<p><strong>What will my treatment include?</strong></p>
					<p>It depends! There are similarities between diseased-states but no two people present exactly the same. Therefore your treatment plan must be individualized and will take into account your physical, mental, and emotional health. Dr. Sciuk works with you to address the root cause of imbalance.</p>
