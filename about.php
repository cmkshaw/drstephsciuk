					<p>Hello and welcome. I am a Naturopathic Doctor working in beautiful Barrie, Ontario. Please read on to learn a little bit about me:</p>

					<p>As a kid growing up in “the Shwa” aka Oshawa, I spent most of my time playing on sports teams, snowboarding with friends, and hanging out with my family and beloved golden retriever.</p>

					<p>While attending Queen’s University for my undergraduate degrees, I worked as a lifeguard, competed in intramurals, and traveled to Melbourne, Australia for an academic exchange program.</p>

					<p>During my exchange in Melbourne I met a Naturopathic doctor that introduced me to a whole new way of approaching healthcare. This timely meeting sparked my passion for holistic medicine and upon my return I enrolled at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine to pursue my medical degree.</p>

					<p>While at CCNM I struggled with my own digestive health issues. I sought advice from my medical doctor, specialist, and naturopathic doctor. With the help of my ND, I regained control over my symptoms and successfully healed my gut. Upon graduating from CCNM and successfully completing my licensing exams I moved to Barrie, Ontario to begin my family practice.</p>

					<p>Thanks for getting to know a little bit about me. I can’t wait to get to know you! Please call (705) 726-0923 to book a free 15-minute meet and greet where we discuss how naturopathic medicine can help you achieve your healthcare goals.</p>
